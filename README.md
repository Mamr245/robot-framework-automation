<h1 align="center">Robot Framework Automation Project :robot:</h1> 

### :question: What is it about?
This project was the final challenge of a Robot Framework training I had. It allowed me to use a wide variety of features present within RobotFramework and learn about this automation tool.
It performs a End-2-End test on https://thetestingworld.com/testings/. The goal was to apply what I learned during the course 
It runs everyday using GitHub Actions and the results can be checked [here](https://github.com/Mamr245/playwright-test-automation/actions). 

### :hammer: Used Technologies
`Pycharm` `RobotFramework`

### :speech_balloon: Have any suggestions or have found an issue? 
Feel free to tell me about it :speech_balloon: I'm always looking to improve!
