<h1 align="center">Robot Framework Automation Project :robot:</h1> 

### :question: What is this?
This project served as the final challenge of a Robot Framework training program, enabling me to utilize a broad range of features within Robot Framework and deepen my understanding of this automation tool. It performs an end-to-end test on https://thetestingworld.com/testings/ , applying the skills acquired throughout the course. The test is executed everyday via GitHub Actions, and the results can be reviewed here [here](https://github.com/Mamr245/robot-framework-automation/actions). 

### :hammer: Technologies used:
`Pycharm` `RobotFramework` `Selenium` `XPath`

### :speech_balloon: Have any suggestions or have found an issue? 
Feel free to reach out! I'm always open to feedback and eager to improve.
